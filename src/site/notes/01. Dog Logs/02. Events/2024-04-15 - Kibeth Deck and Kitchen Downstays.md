# Notes
Took Kibeth onto the deck with a prepared tray of treats. Mostly kibble with powdered freeze dried salmon and one well of freeze dried chicken chunks and another well with freshly baked chicken and rice treats. 

Yellow Mat
Tethered

The treats were good. Having salmon on the kibble made them appealing I think. 
## Outdoor
- 13 minutes
- I had a coffee
- First few minutes were tense looking for Shiva
- The latter half she relaxed into it until Loki started complaining from inside and then I got distracted with him
## Indoor with Back door open, screen door closed
- 20 minutes
- Most used her breakfast kibble with seasoning
- Switched to cookies and chicken when bird cries were close
- Settled into the activity well. 
- Observant but relaxed
- Turned to me frequently for treats
-

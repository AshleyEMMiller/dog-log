1. Warm Up - Pine in hand to start (working on click no meaning turn away immediately)
2. Verticals - Winter green in metal magnet tin on stove then along fridge at hgher intervals. 3 second nose freeze.
3. Brain Break - beef cheek chew for a few minutes
4. Mat Stay and Loki  co-work - poor mat stay while I did scale with Loki because he wanted to work and was sort of in the way. Blake came home and she stayed on the mat until I released her though she was very excited about Blake. Loki stayed working and then I released him and he realized that Blake was home, said hello then came back to  work. Kibeth came back to work when she realized Loki was getting food. 
5. Room Search -

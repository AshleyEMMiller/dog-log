## Reflection
Loki's presence may keep Kibeth's reactivity in check, partcularly if I place him in front of the door üòà because she daren't bark her fool head off at the people/things outside if it also means he's caught in the cone of sound. 

KIbeth also, humorously went to the larger more comfortable yellow mat at first and relegated Lokito the smaller, slippy grey mat. So I had to reset them because Loki would do the downtay but he certainly wasn't comfortable on the grey may. He was much more comfortable on the yellow mat where he could flop his hip on the more cushioned surface

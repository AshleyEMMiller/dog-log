# Notes
Media:: 
Cover:: 

Taught Kibeth first stages of [[02. Dog Training/Training/Protocols/Look At That\|Look At That]] using a Mug as the neutral stimulus. Jumped ahead too quickly and she developed a stereotype of turning in a direction not looking at the mug. 
Will go back to presenting the Mug from behind my back on both sides so she understands that the mug is the object. reluctant to put mug on the floor because she will think she needs to interact with it. 
## Reflection
It is better to go slowly (even if it is boring) than jump ahead and confuse her.

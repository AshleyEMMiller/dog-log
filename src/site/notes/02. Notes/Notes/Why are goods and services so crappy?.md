[[Planned Obsolescence\|Planned Obsolescence]], [[Consumerism\|Consumerism]] and [[Monopolies\|Monopolies]]

Good video, but I would like to add a rebuttal. While product design must factor in manufacturability, functionality and appearance and buying habits (like frequent purchasing and fast fashion, etc) have a role to play in the cycle. I don't entirely agree that the overemphasis on manufacturability is meant to keep prices low. Last year Harvard Business School released a working paper showing that from 2006 to 2019 markup (the cost of production and selling) decreased by 30% , but prices went up by 2% across the board for buyers. The authors argue that decreased competition and decreasing consumer price sensitivity were allowed corporations to keep prices higher despite decreasing costs of production and as a result increase their profit margins. https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=61401


When we add in the COVID-19 pandemic, people were already used to paying more for things and then, with the complexities of supply chain disruptions and various lockdowns, people accepted higher prices because there was an obvious reason. But when those problems eased, consumers were still paying high prices because companies could charge them. Here in Canada, the Bank of Canada (which has been jacking up interest rates to curb inflation) acknowledged in 2023.

I have a speculation that more adults are diagnosed with ADHD in the last few years for a few reasons and I want to tease apart which factor has the biggest influence. Is it: 
1. Social Media and online communities raising awareness
2. COVID-19 kaibashing ADHD'ers duct taped jerry rigged systems for coping
3. COVID-19 leading to widespread burnout and fatigue making it even harder for neurodivergent people to cope
4. Modern society and its emphasis on sedentary life and radically increasing complexity?
5. Technology but not for shortening attention spans, but by being distracting and stimulating, making it harder for people ADHDers to quiet their minds. 
6. Millenial stress - (everyone is stressed, but post boomers and maybe Gen-X) Millenials and Gen Z are in a very challenging socio economic landscape that makes it harder to survive on minumum wage so that those with ADHD are having an even harder time.

These are interesting questions and I think all of them might have a role to play. Adults with ADHD would have had ADHD as children, but if they were driven, intelligent and had a family environment that picked up the slack, it would have masked the symptoms (especially inatttentive type)

I guess the other thing is that growing up we didnt have technology as much. I personally wasn't allowed to watch TV during the week unless it was educational. We didn't have video games until I was in high school. So we played outside. I biked around our driveway (couldn't go on the road, it wasn't safe). But it wasn't until high school that we had a computer I could use the internet on. I wonder how much sitting all day and not playing outside makes the ADHD worse. 

I don't think that ADHD is misdiagnosed, but I do think that making kids sit still for hours and hours all day when we know sitting isn't good for them, isn't going to help anyone thrive, much less those with ADHD. So maybe the increase in ADHD diagnosis is that we are better able to recognize various manifestations of it and those who weren't diagnosed as kids because they were high achievers or didn't cause trouble or flew under the radar just got by through brute force. 

I also wonder how brute forcing your way through modern functioning can play a role in ADHD depression. If, as the Nautilus article said, stress is to mental health what smoking is to heart health, then how does the stress of working harder to achieve or self-regulate fit in?

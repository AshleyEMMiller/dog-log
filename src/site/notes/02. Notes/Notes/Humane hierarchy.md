The Humane Hierarchy was developed by Dr. Susan Friedman and has been widely adopted by accreditation bodies. It falls under the [[LIMA\|LIMA]] framework of "Least invasive, minimally aversive" behaviour modification. The intent is to start from the bottom of the hierarchy to address problem behaviours step-wise moving from the bottom to the top. 

I disagree that the stepwise approach must be employed for **all** behaviour problems. But it is valuable to consider what behaviour you can encourage to address annoying or problematic behaviours instead of only focusing on the behaviours you want to stop. Even from the perspective of those that employ punishment, [[@chanceFirstCourseApplied2006\|Chance (2006)]], [[04. Sources/Steve White's Eight Rules for Punishment\|White]] and [[04. Sources/Ian Dunbars Eight Rules for Punishment\|Dunbar]] all include a variation on "The learner mush know the alternative behaviour and be able to perform it" in their various rules around punishment. 

From the perspective of working with novice dog owners, it is valuable to ask them to mentally exercise asking themselves a series of questions about the basis of problem behaviours. If your dog is under-exercised or in pain, you cannot address the problem behaviour until its health and enrichment needs are met. 

I might even add an even lower tier beneath the Health, Nutrition and Physical Setting section about "Age and Development". Irith Bloom brought up in her webinar [[04. Sources/This means war - How to deal with fence fighting\|This means war - How to deal with fence fighting]] Unfortunately, sometimes you have to wait for a dog's brain to develop before they can learn to stop a behaviour or self-regulate. 

This is not the only way or approach to dealing with problem behaviours. Other options include [[02. Dog Training/Training/Theory/Desensitization\|Desensitization]] and [[02. Dog Training/Training/Theory/Counter Conditioning\|Counter Conditioning]]. But it provides a useful framework to get started with things. 
# The Hierarchy
![[Humane hierarchy_image_1.png\|Humane hierarchy_image_1.png]]

## Health, Nutrition and Physical Setting
Is the dog healthy? Is the dog pain-free? Is the dog safe? These are the first questions to be asked when dealing with a problem behaviour. If the dog is in pain, their tolerance and capacity to cope will be limited. If they are sick, the same is true. 

I would also include "welfare" as a part of health and ask questions about the dogs social, cognitive and emotional needs (not just physical). Is the dog getting enough enrichment? Does the dog have enough social time with other dogs? Is the dog getting enough quiet and rest? In some situations, addressing the dog's welfare needs (i.e. [[02. Notes/Notes/The Five Freedoms\|The Five Freedoms]]) may either eliminate or go a long way to resolving the problem. These include: 
- Access to appropriate food and water
- Comfortable environment
- Health, uninjured and pain-free
- Able to express normal behaviour
- Free from mental suffering

## Antecedent Arrangement (Management)

**Management** is a strategy in which the trainer prevents the learner from performing undesirable behaviour by minimizing or removing the **antecedent** that initiates the target behaviour. The intent is to reduce the number of times the dog practices the undesirable behaviour. Every time a dog performs an undesirable behaviour, it becomes stronger and more habitual. 

>[!quote] Practice does not make perfect, it makes permanent. 
>- Sue Alexander

Examples of **Antecedent Arrangement** include:
- Using a fan to blow away scents from the crate of a smell-sensitive dog (i.e. the dog gets over-aroused and reacts to smells of other animals)
	- Target Behaviour: the dog displays barrier aggression while in the crate when other smells are around
- Putting window film up on a main window facing the street
	- Target Behaviour: Barking at people and dogs outside of a window
- Asking friends and family members not to knock on the door or ring a doorbell when they arrive and instead to text
	- Target Behaviour: The dog barks when the doorbell goes off
- Barring access to certain parts of the yard along the fence line
	- Target Behaviour: Fence fighting
- Feeding dogs in separate rooms in a multi-dog household
	- Target Behaviour: Resource guarding between dogs
- White noise machine or putting the radio on in a room the dog is crated in
	- Target Behaviour: Barking at sounds outside the home

Management will fail due to human error, equipment error, or other extenuating circumstances. It is not a permanent solution, but it is a first step to controlling the environment so that other strategies can be applied or taught to the dog.

The addition of something that increases the likelihood of a desirable behaviour. Paying your dog for what you want them to do. 

In the context of problem behaviours, examples of behaviours to teach and reinforce include: 
- Settling on a mat
- Giving eye contact
- Returning to the handler
- Calmly observing the environment/trigger

>[!important] It is important that the dog's arousal is low enough that they can think clearly and can learn and perform the behaviours. The dog should not be near or above threshold.

## Differential Reinforcement of Alternate Behaviours
>[!note] I would argue that this section should just be [[02. Dog Training/Training/Theory/Differential Reinforcement\|Differential Reinforcement]] as there are three main types (according to [[Applied Behaviour Analysis\|Applied Behaviour Analysis]]) that can be useful in these situations.

### Differential Reinforcement of Alternate Behaviour
[[02. Dog Training/Training/Theory/Differential Reinforcement of Alternate Behaviour\|Differential Reinforcement of Alternate Behaviour]] (DRA) is one of three kinds of [[02. Dog Training/Training/Theory/Differential Reinforcement\|Differential Reinforcement]] .It involves reinforcing another behaviour while the undesirable behaviour is on [[02. Dog Training/Training/Theory/Extinction\|Extinction]] (see below). The reinforcers that maintained the undesirable behaviour are given **only** when the dog performs an acceptable alternate behaviour. 

An example would be the [[Elevator Game\|Elevator Game]] (which doesn't resolve a behaviour problem per se, but bear with me). In this game the handler fills the dog's bowl with food. The dog has two options: they can pester the person for the bowl, or they can wait in a sit/down to get the food. If pestering is not reinforced (i.e. it's on extinction or is Negatively Punished) but waiting is reinforced, the dog is more likely to offer that behaviour.

The core concept of DRA is that desirable and undesirable behaviours are functionally equivalent (for the learner) if they lead to the same outcome. Pestering people for food and waiting politely for food are both ways to get food. But once the dog is reliably reinforced for waiting politely, they are more likely to offer that behaviour, as long as pestering for food is no longer reinforced. 

### Differential Reinforcement of Incompatible Behaviour
"[[02. Dog Training/Training/Theory/Differential Reinforcement of Incompatible Behaviour\|Differential Reinforcement of Incompatible Behaviour]]" (DRI) is a form of DRA. However, in DRI the alternate behaviours are specifically **incompatible** with the undesirable target behaviour. In DRA the alternate behaviour does not have to be incompatible. It just needs to be different. 

### Examples of DRA/DRI
Examples of undesirable behaviours and reinforceable alternatives are: 
- Being underfoot while the handler is cooking in the kitchen
	- Alternate Behaviour: When the handler is in the kitchen, the dog goes to mat
- Barking and lunging at a squirrel while on leash
	- Alternate Behaviour: Giving eye contact to the handler when they see a squirrel
- Barking and running at the door when the doorbell rings.
	- Alternate Behaviour: Going to a distant spot away from the door (e.g the top of a landing) and waiting there

### Differential Reinforcement of Low Rate

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><a class="markdown-embed-link" href="/02-dog-training/training/theory/differential-reinforcement-of-low-rate/#cdfe96" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-link"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a><div class="markdown-embed">



A third kind of differential reinforcement is [[02. Dog Training/Training/Theory/Differential Reinforcement of Low Rate\|Differential Reinforcement of Low Rate]] (DRL). DRL is a way to decrease the intensity of a target behaviour by only reinforcing it when it is "smaller" in some way. Either the intensity of the behaviour (e.g. loudness of the bark), the frequency of a behaviour in a time window, or increasing the time between the behaviour. In this situation [[02. Dog Training/Training/Theory/Shaping\|Shaping]] may be used to gradually decrease the target behaviour's rate to a manageable level.  

</div></div>


## Extinction

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><a class="markdown-embed-link" href="/02-dog-training/training/theory/extinction/" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-link"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a><div class="markdown-embed">




If an operant behaviour is maintained because of reinforcers, removing reinforcers should decrease the frequency of a target behaviour. It will not completely remove a behaviour, but it will decrease it to manageable levels.

Extinction can be difficult to implement, and there are a lot of ways to fuck it up. This is mostly because for this to work properly you must withhold ALL (and I mean ALLLL) of the reinforcers that maintain a target behaviour. Firstly the reinforcers may not be obvious or known and sometimes because of things like Bootstrap Reinforcement, other situations/people/scenarios may reinforce the target behaviour. 

In addition without [[02. Dog Training/Training/Theory/Differential Reinforcement\|Differential Reinforcement]] (see above) the learner can get very frustrated and quite stressed due to the lack of information. So it is important to pair extinction with DR (DRA, DRI or DRL). Give the dog information about the correct answer and give that information promptly and reliably. 
### Rules of Extinction 
[[@chanceFirstCourseApplied2006\|Chance (2006)]]
1. Define the target behaviour
2. Identify the reinforcers that maintain the behaviour
3. Remove **ALL** reinforcers for the target behaviour
4. Monitor results

</div></div>


## Negative Punishment
Removal of something to decrease the frequency of a behaviour. Warning the dog of the impending punishment gives them a chance to change their behaviour. 

Kibeth bit my arms as a puppy. If she kept it up after a warning she got a time out and I removed myself or she went into her crate and "lost a turn". 
## Negative Reinforcement
The removal of something leads to an increase in behaviour. Often this is associated with Escape and Avoidance behaviours
- Escape: Stimulus removed after a behaviour
- Active Avoidance: Behaviour avoids stimulus

An example of a natural reinforcer is Loki's walking around puddles. He does not like his feet being wet, and walking around the puddles allows him to actively avoid the stimulus of wet feet. 

## Positive Punishment
The addition of something that decreases the likelihood of a behaviour. 

For more details see [[02. Dog Training/Training/Theory/Positive Punishment\|Positive Punishment]]

# When is the hierarchy not appropriate?
For example, I will apply [[02. Dog Training/Training/Theory/Negative Punishment\|Negative Punishment]] when a puppy bites me by giving them a timeout or leaving the room (after appropriate warning). I have several reasons for this. The first is that we have to think about the handler and their ability to cope with the situation. Frankly, my ability to make good choices and regulate my emotions drops off a cliff when I'm in pain. If my puppy is causing me pain, I may make a choice I regret. The safest thing for both of us is to get the puppy away. 

Secondly, there is a level of clarity that can be skipping steps and going for something like negative reinforcement or even differentialy reinforcement of alternate behaviour. I would also argue that there may be circumstances where positive punishment (**when applied correctly**) may be the most humane thing for resolving a problem behaviour.  There is something to be said for providing a few ==clear punishers== rather than a bunch of ==muddled reinforcers== particularly if we are considering the welfare of the animals in our care. 

>[!quote] Clear is kind. Unclear is unkind.
>- Dr. Brene Brown

Thirdly, safety may not make it possible to work through all the steps to resolve a problem behaviour in a timely manner. When Loki was an adolescent, he jumped fences. When I sent him to boarding with Sue and John, before I'd left he jumped their 4-ft fence. They live too close to an 80 km road for that to happen again and, with my permission, Sue installed the electrified fence on the dog yard. She was very careful about how she explained not to jump fences. There were no other dogs in the yard, no other triggers outside of the yard and when he touched the fence, he learned that "it bites, don't climb it." This was effective punishment because other possible associations were removed (no other dogs were present) and so he understood clearly that the fence caused the shock. The shock came after he touched it and he learned that his contact with the fence made it bite. As long as he didn't climb or touch the fence he could do as he pleased. I think Sue may have also consoled him from the window after the fence shocked him under her supervision. It sounds cruel when I write it like that, but having my dog die from being hit by a transport truck would have been worse than him receiving a shock four to five times in his entire life. (See [[02. Dog Training/Training/Theory/Positive Punishment\|Positive Punishment]] for rules around effective and safe positive punishment.)

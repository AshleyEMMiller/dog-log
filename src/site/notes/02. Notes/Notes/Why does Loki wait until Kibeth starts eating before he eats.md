On several occasions, Loki gets his food first but won't start eating until he sees Kibeth begin to eat her food. At first, I thought it was him waiting for me to say, "Take It." But he waits until she's started eating. I cannot tell if it is [[Social Facilitation\|Social Facilitation]], [[Resource Guarding\|Resource Guarding]], or bonding and relationship. 

If it's Resource Guarding, then he is eating his food, so she doesn't eat it. 
If it's social facilitation, then he is eating because she is eating and that is what you do. 
If it is bonding then it's similar to social facilitation in that it's something they're doing "together". 

Either way, when I feed him outside, he sometimes ignores his food entirely and I wonder how hungry he actually is. Is Kibeth eating overriding his lack of appetite because of other motivations?

Loki and Kibeth trade off on the last of their meals. Loki will eat whatever Kibeth leaves behind from her puzzle toys and Kibeth will eat his left overs or will lick his supplements from his bowl.

A citizen science project based in the USA that launched on November 14th 2024. Originally the project only collected survey data and biological samples from companion dogs in the USA with plans to expand into other countries. The project is funded by the US National Insititutes of Health under their aging subdivision. They also receive some for profit and non-profit organizations that support the project to cover expenses that NIH does not cover (e.g. food costs, events, etc.)

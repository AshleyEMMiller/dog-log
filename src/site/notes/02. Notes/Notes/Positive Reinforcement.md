The addition of something that increases the likelihood of a desirable behaviour. Paying your dog for what you want them to do. 

In the context of problem behaviours, examples of behaviours to teach and reinforce include: 
- Settling on a mat
- Giving eye contact
- Returning to the handler
- Calmly observing the environment/trigger

>[!important] It is important that the dog's arousal is low enough that they can think clearly and can learn and perform the behaviours. The dog should not be near or above threshold.

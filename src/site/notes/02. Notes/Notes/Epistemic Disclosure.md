I came across the idea of Epistemic Disclosure in Maggie Appleton's post on Digital Gardens, and it resonated with me because it liberates me from being right when I say things. I can articulate at the front of the note how much time I've dedicated to this idea and how confident I am that it's legitimate. It's like a written form of "don't quote me," which I say often in real life. 

I need something simple to implement and understand so it doesn't become laborious to do for every note and maintain consistency. It's good practice to reflect on how I know what I know and how confident I am in what I'm saying. 

Here is the coding system I'll employ at the top of all (non MOC) Permanent Notes. MOC's are going to be hubs for lots of notes and therefore each linked (or embedded) note will have its own Epistemic Disclosure Statement. Source Notes are directly from a source and I won't bother with the epistemic disclosure since the information about the source will be provided. 

- **Epistemic Effort** = ⛏️ (number of pick-axes out of 5 indicates how much effort I put into understanding this idea)
	- 1 = No External Sources
	- 2 = One source
	- 3 = Two or more sources
	- 4 = Three or more sources which legitimately counter each other
	- 5 = Five or more sources which provide nuance and context
- **Epistemic Certainty** (How confident am I that this is valid or  generalizable)
	- 🥽 Uncertain
	- 👓 Semi-certain
	- 🕶️ Confident
- **Garden Status**: is more about where this idea is at in terms of thinking, processing and cleaning up
	- 🫘 - Seed (quick-capture, fleeting ideas, questions)
	- 🌱 - Seedling (processed beyond first thought, but still rough)
	- 🌿- Shrub (restructured, edited)
	- 🌳 - Tree (returned to and polished)
	- 🍀 - Anecdote

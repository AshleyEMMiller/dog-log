# Overview
| Intention        | Build engagement with the dog to warm them up and build buy-in and to assess the dog's arousal level and whether they are in the mindset to cope with their environment (or teach clicker = treat to novice dogs).     |
| ---------------- | -------------------- |
| **Description**  | As long as the dog is maintaining increasing engagement with the handler they will progress through: Click = Treat (x5), Name & Feed (x5), Name => Eye contact = Click & Treat. If the dog loses focus or cannot maintain engagement, go back to a previous stage.  |
| **Applications** | In challenging environments,As a way to get the dog ready for work (i.e. warm up),As a way to return the dog's attention to the handler when distracted,As a way to ask the dog whether they actually can engage and work in this context. |

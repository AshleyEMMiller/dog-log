# Teaching Steps
## Shaping & Prompting
>[!note]- Training Techniques
>- Shaping: clicking for standing and progressively getting into the bow with lowered head, then lowered head and bent elbows, etc
>- Prompting: placing the treat on the floor acts as a prompt to encourage the dogs head to lower and keep their head close to the ground
1. Mark for the dog standing still on their feet
2. Place treats on the floor
3. Rapid fire mark for the dog's head being low to the ground (even if they are chewing) and continue feeding on the ground. Eventually the dog will hold the "lowered head" position. Slow marking and wait for additional behaviours
4. Mark for lowered head and shifting front feet or bending elbows
5. When the dog lowers elbows into a bow, rapid-fire Cue-Mark-Feed ~10 times(the dog can hold this position and so there is time to get the cue in)
6. On the final marker, toss the treat to get the dog out of position and begin shaping from the beginning.
7. Repeat from the beginning until the dog progresses through the steps and through subsequent training sessions fade out the earlier stages of the progressions once the dog knows the assignment 
	1. i.e. At the start of a new training session, start from the beginning of the shaping progression (mark for standing, mark for lowered head, mark for bent elbows), but once they know the target activity, fade out the reinforcement for the standing and only mark for lowered head, then only mark for lowered head with bent elbows.
	2. Do not skip ahead too quickly, or the dog will become frustrated and offer unwanted behaviours. 
8. If the dog lays down, take a step backwards to encourage them to get back on their feet and click for standing

## Amendments and Considerations
- Use a surface with enough traction and soft enough for them to want to put their weight on their elbows and be able to stay in position.

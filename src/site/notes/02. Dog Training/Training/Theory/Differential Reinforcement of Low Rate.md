Reinforcing the target behaviour only when it occurs at a lower rate. The rate can either mean the number of times it occurs in a given period or reinforcing only after it has occurred after a certain period of time. Over time the rate of the target behaviour should decrease to a manageable/desirable level

Examples protocols include:

## Humane Hierarchy
A third kind of differential reinforcement is [[02. Dog Training/Training/Theory/Differential Reinforcement of Low Rate\|Differential Reinforcement of Low Rate]] (DRL). DRL is a way to decrease the intensity of a target behaviour by only reinforcing it when it is "smaller" in some way. Either the intensity of the behaviour (e.g. loudness of the bark), the frequency of a behaviour in a time window, or increasing the time between the behaviour. In this situation [[02. Dog Training/Training/Theory/Shaping\|Shaping]] may be used to gradually decrease the target behaviour's rate to a manageable level.

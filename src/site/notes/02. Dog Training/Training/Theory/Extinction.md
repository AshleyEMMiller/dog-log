If an operant behaviour is maintained because of reinforcers, removing reinforcers should decrease the frequency of a target behaviour. It will not completely remove a behaviour, but it will decrease it to manageable levels.

Extinction can be difficult to implement, and there are a lot of ways to fuck it up. This is mostly because for this to work properly you must withhold ALL (and I mean ALLLL) of the reinforcers that maintain a target behaviour. Firstly the reinforcers may not be obvious or known and sometimes because of things like Bootstrap Reinforcement, other situations/people/scenarios may reinforce the target behaviour. 

In addition without [[02. Dog Training/Training/Theory/Differential Reinforcement\|Differential Reinforcement]] (see above) the learner can get very frustrated and quite stressed due to the lack of information. So it is important to pair extinction with DR (DRA, DRI or DRL). Give the dog information about the correct answer and give that information promptly and reliably. 
### Rules of Extinction 
[[@chanceFirstCourseApplied2006\|Chance (2006)]]
1. Define the target behaviour
2. Identify the reinforcers that maintain the behaviour
3. Remove **ALL** reinforcers for the target behaviour
4. Monitor results

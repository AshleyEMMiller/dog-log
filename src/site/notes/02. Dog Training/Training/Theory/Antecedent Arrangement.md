**Management** is a strategy in which the trainer prevents the learner from performing undesirable behaviour by minimizing or removing the **antecedent** that initiates the target behaviour. The intent is to reduce the number of times the dog practices the undesirable behaviour. Every time a dog performs an undesirable behaviour, it becomes stronger and more habitual.

Examples of **Antecedent Arrangement** include:
- Using a fan to blow away scents from the crate of a smell-sensitive dog (i.e. the dog gets over-aroused and reacts to smells of other animals)
	- Target Behaviour: the dog displays barrier aggression while in the crate when other smells are around
- Putting window film up on a main window facing the street
	- Target Behaviour: Barking at people and dogs outside of a window
- Asking friends and family members not to knock on the door or ring a doorbell when they arrive and instead to text
	- Target Behaviour: The dog barks when the doorbell goes off
- Barring access to certain parts of the yard along the fence line
	- Target Behaviour: Fence fighting
- Feeding dogs in separate rooms in a multi-dog household
	- Target Behaviour: Resource guarding between dogs
- White noise machine or putting the radio on in a room the dog is crated in
	- Target Behaviour: Barking at sounds outside the home

Management will fail due to human error, equipment error, or other extenuating circumstances. It is not a permanent solution, but it is a first step to controlling the environment so that other strategies can be applied or taught to the dog.

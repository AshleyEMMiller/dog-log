# Highlights and Captures
## Content
### Fence Fighting and More
Fence fighting is one of several barrier-related problem behaviours. 
- **Classic fence fighting**
	- dog behind a fence, things pass by and the dog barks
- **Barrier frustration** 
	- Barrier between the dog and the world and they react differently with the barrier in place
		- Crate agression/Gate Agression
		- Even with "Invisible Fences" 
		- Vocalizing while in another room 
- **Leash Reactivity**
	- not always the case (similar to fence fighting)
#### Constraint/Restraint
- The animal is not able to do what they want to do and they don't have control
- Often what triggers behaviours

### Why this starts (and persists)
There are several (potentially overlapping) causes for fence fighting/barrier frustration behaviours
#### Longing
- FOMO (window barking, barrier frustration) - want to get involved with something
	- Can start to feed into a behaviour pattern that is because they want to be involved by barking and pulling
	- They start out with a happy feeling, but because they cannot get to the thing, it spirals into frustration
- Stress levels become very high
- The frustration can tip into other things
- Regardless the behaviour, they are unhappy
- Running back and forth is a release of pent-up energy
#### Startle
- Another option is because they get startled.
- They start by barking, then want to interact but experience frustration
#### Alert
- We selected dogs to alert us to hazards in the environment. 
	- Wolves do not bark as adults, only pups bark
	- Dogs were selected for barking into adulthood
- For the dog: "My job is to tell you what's going on"
#### Stay away
- Some dogs may bark because they are guarding
- They are informing the approacher to keep their distance or else
- Sometimes may happen around things like invisible fences
#### Irritation
- The dog may be irritated by behaviour on the other side of the barrier (e.g. people fucking around on the other side of a fence or rattling it)
#### Reinforcement
- The dog learns that when they bark the thing moves away
- **Control is very reinforcing**
- The barking can turn into a "keep going"/"move along" signal
	- This is regardless of whether the trigger is actually moving away in response to the barking or they are passing by and would have moved on anyway
- This leads to longer bouts of overreacting
#### Habit
- If the trigger moved away enough times (for the individual), they get so reinforced that they just build a habit/habitual
- Habits work by not being driven by the consequence. They are driven by the antecedence. Even if the consequence changes the antecedent ellicits the behaviour.
- For a well-established fence-fighting habit changing the consequence
- Sometimes the behaviour is not even emotionally driven, it becomes a routine
- The trigger makes the behaviour
- Many dogs have built fence fighting as a habit. The consequence is no longer happening

### Practical Tips
#### Management
- Identify triggers and eliminate them
	- Block access
	- keep the animal out of the area
	- prevent them from experiencing the trigger
	- set up a fence 
	- increase distance from barrier
	- play white noice
	- reduce the triggering
- This is the first step to retrain and build different habits
- Prevent the behaviour from being triggered over and over and over

#### Teach New Habits
##### Default Eye Contact
**To Teach**
- Stand in front of the dog and wait for them to look at you 
	- Mark for eye contact
	- treat low so the dog breaks the eye contact
- No verbal cue, the person's presence is the cue
- Teach the dog that giving eye contact will often get reinforced and this means that you have the dog's attention

##### Puppy Zen
>[!Note] A "Leave It" model for dealing with triggers
>- Leave it/Cued-take it transfers well from one situation to another
>- Once the dog understands the [[Leave It\|Leave It]] cue means leave the thing and look at me, you can apply it (in a controlled manner) to triggers passing by
>	- Do this at a difficulty level that your dog can tolerate. 

**To Teach**
- Recap eye contact with the dog
- Hold treat out to the side and wait for the dog to make eye contact, mark and feed
- Eventually the dog will ignore the treat in favour of eye contact
>[!idea] For small dogs it may be more comfortable for them to make eye contact if you crouch lower
###### Adding the "Leave it" cue
- Adding the cue leave it when the dog disengages from the treat in your hand. 
- Do the same thing for a treat on the floor
>[!important] Introduce the cue when the behaviour is reliable

##### Check-it Out
>[!note]
>- Similar to "[[02. Dog Training/Training/Protocols/Look At That\|Look At That]]" and its used to teach a dog to look at the thing calmly, look at the trigger and look away or look at the person (there is no hierarchy)
>- Useful for fence-fighting because it teaches the dog the habit of looking and looking away, looking and disengaging and teaching them to feel better about the trigger. When they're in the presence of the trigger they can have a choice about how they interact. 
>- If they overreact, manage with distance or decreasing trigger intensity
>- Assuming that the dog can eat calmly (not sharky) keep playing the game. Otherwise get distance. 
>- Can be used in the presence of the trigger.

**To Teach**
- Present the dog with the trigger at a safe distance where the dog is below threshold and can calmly engage with the trigger
- Mark for any of the following (all are acceptable)
	- The dog looks at the trigger
	- The dog looks that the trigger then at the handler
	- the dog looks at the handler (pay special attention to this one, as you may sometimes miss it, even small glances count, pay every time)
- Do not walk directly towards the trigger.
	- If the dog walks directly towards the trigger mark and call the dog back
- Pay attention to the dog's tension and get more distance/give a break if they start to become stiff.
###### Modification: Find It
- On-leash activity
- Keep sessions very very short
- While at a below-threshold distance from unavoidable/inescapable triggers get the dog's engagement by tossing a few treats
- Using any of the above criteria toss a treat to the dog
	- The dog looks at the trigger
	- The dog looks that the trigger then at the handler
	- the dog looks at the handler
- Transition to tossing treats for the dog to "[[02. Dog Training/Training/Protocols/Find It\|Find It]]"
	- This is a fun game that will build a different behavioural habit in the presence of the other dog

##### Settle on a Mat
>[!note] 
>- The goal is the dog relaxes into the mat and doesn't want to get up
>- If you give dogs cues, they go into obedience mode
>- This is not a [[Go To Mat\|Go To Mat]] where the dog is on the mat but ready to transition into movement
>- The application is that you can set the dog up far enough away from the trigger that they can settle on the mat and watch things going by without going over threshold.
>	- Over time you can bring the mat closer to the trigger (in a controlled manner)

**To Teach**
- Keep sessions short (1 - 1.5 minutes)
- Present towel/mat and feed on the mat as long as they have at least two paws 
	- No verbal cue. The mat is the cue.
	- Be slow and relaxed in the movements to encourage relaxation in the dog
- The dog may transition to sitting and laying down; continue to feed
	- "Feed the towel" - place treat on towel, do not feed directly to their mouth
- Look for relaxation, flopped hip, relaxed face, etc.
- Release with a toss away from the mat and pick up the mat (since it is the cue)
>[!idea] For dogs who get excited about food
>- Smear lickable food on the mat. Licking tends to decrease arousal
>- Use a [[Control Unleashed\|Control Unleashed]] approach and use petting or massage as the reinforcer
###### Adding the "Settle" Cue
- Once the dog understands relaxation on the mat, name the behaviour "Settle" which is **not** the same as [[Go To Mat\|Go To Mat]]
- Transition the cue to other objects (bed, couch, post-it note)
>[!idea] Use the "Settle" cue and quiet petting whenever the dog is in a relaxed state (resting on a couch, bed or mat)

##### Thank you for Barking
>[!note]
>- Originally called "Click for barking"
>- Remember: Dogs were selected for alert barking. Once we indicate that we know about the trigger they may settle down
>- Similar to [[02. Dog Training/Training/Protocols/Cookie Jar Protocol\|Cookie Jar Protocol]]
>	- The mark can be a verbal "Thank you"
>	- The mark can be a rattling cookie jar
>- We are teaching our dogs that the trigger is a signal that they should find a human
>	- "Oh you saw a thing outside? Come tell me about it. I'll give you a treat for being such a good guard dog."
>- Many dogs will eventually stop barking or will reduce the number of barks before they stop
>-  Technique: [[02. Dog Training/Training/Theory/Differential Reinforcement of Low Rate\|Differential Reinforcement of Low Rate]]

 **To Teach**
 - Present the trigger
	 - Door Knocking/Door Bell
	- Dog related sounds
	- Car related sounds
- The dog barks at the trigger
- Handler marks at the first bark and provides treats
- Mark every time the dog starts another volley of barks
	- The dog will eventually offer a single bark and then return to the handler for treats
- Do not mark and treat for the dog barking at you (they're playing silly buggers at this point)
- When doing a session: 
	- Start with marking for barking at the trigger
	- Mark and feed every time the trigger happens and the dog barks
	- Mark and feed every time the trigger happens and the dog moves towards the trigger but does not bark
	- Between instances of the trigger you can feed to manage the arousal (but be sparing and move slowly to reduce the dog's arousal)

#### How to apply in real life
- Begin with **Management**
- Relax management ==**only**== when you are prepared to train
	- You must be ready to work your dog
	- You must be present and attentive to work with your dog and train them to behave appropriately
- Have fall-back plans
	- You must have an escape plan when things go badly so your dog does not continue to practice the undesirable behaviour
- Gradually build difficult
	- Slowly get closer to the trigger/barrier
	- Keep your dog on a leash so you can encourage them away from the trigger if things go to hell
- Expect setbacks
- Let the animal guide you


## Q&A Session
![This means war - How to deal with fence fighting_image_2.png|500](/img/user/05.%20Resources/Attachments/This%20means%20war%20-%20How%20to%20deal%20with%20fence%20fighting_image_2.png)
- The similar motivation of frustration
- Teach the dogs an organized way to deal with the situation
- Mats
	- Irith likes using mats as "Corners" like fighters in a ring who go to their corner after a round to regroup 
		- each dog has an assigned mat in these kinds of tight spaces
	- The dogs are sent to their assigned mats and are released one at a time to do whatever it is they want to do or to get through the doorway. whoever stays behind gets an extra treat
	- This will involve a lot of cooperation with the household
	- Build a routine for the dogs: my job is to wait on the mat until it is my turn to do the thing
- Hand Target
	- Ask for hand target then send dog A through, then dog B
- Routine stops them from feeling so frustrated
- The entire lecture is about teaching the dog an [[Incompatible alternate behaviour\|Incompatible alternate behaviour]]

![This means war - How to deal with fence fighting_image_3.png](/img/user/05.%20Resources/Attachments/This%20means%20war%20-%20How%20to%20deal%20with%20fence%20fighting_image_3.png)
- In an ideal situation the complaining dog should have been removed away
- If the dog is barking at a trigger, remove them
	- Window film is a great solution to reduce visual stimulation
	- White noise machine so sound is muted
	- A gate at the entrance to the room 
- Until you're ready to do the training and you're ready to do some practice

![This means war - How to deal with fence fighting_image_4.png](/img/user/05.%20Resources/Attachments/This%20means%20war%20-%20How%20to%20deal%20with%20fence%20fighting_image_4.png)
- Assuming classic fence-fighting
	- Hold a steady leash (like a post, don't pull back)
	- The dog will look behind at you as if to say "Come on, can you not see this"
	- When the dog looks at you verbally tell them you'll all go get the "trigger" and jog towards the fence
		- Make sure that the trigger is very safe in this situation
		- Let the dog pull you, but don't go full speed
	- Ideally, the dog will start to look at you sooner in the process and for longer
	- Once the dog offers eye contact quickly, ask for an additional behaviour (more eye contact, sit, spin, heel, etc)
	- [[Premack Principle\|Premack Principle]]:  High-probability behaviours can reinforce low-probability behaviours (assuming that the high-probability behaviour is reinforcing)
		- e.g. There is a high probability that your dog would like to eat a treat so this can be used to reinforce eye contact (which has lower probability). But if the dog isn't motivated by the treat, there must be another high-probability behaviour you can leverage in this situation.
	- When the dog eases up on he barking, back off and reset and repeat
	- You should see the dog come back with you more easily and come back with you more quickly
- Toys are an alternative
	- Tug
	- Fetch
- Overall, find what is more motivating for your dog
	- Distractions are often the best reinforcements. Get what you want by giving them access to that distraction

![This means war - How to deal with fence fighting_image_5.png](/img/user/05.%20Resources/Attachments/This%20means%20war%20-%20How%20to%20deal%20with%20fence%20fighting_image_5.png)
- Yes
- Conditioning a different association
	- Pair "Trigger" with "I'm having a good time"
- Trigger precedes the trigger. 
	- Noticeing the thing predicts that play will happen

![This means war - How to deal with fence fighting_image_6.png](/img/user/05.%20Resources/Attachments/This%20means%20war%20-%20How%20to%20deal%20with%20fence%20fighting_image_6.png)
- Yes. 
- "Call the Dogs Apart" Cue
	- Dogs approach and then call them apart and each of them get a treat
	- Look for the friend's behaviour before they start the barking and that is when you call the dogs for treats
	- As the dogs get better at this they learn a habit to disengage from the play dog and check in with their human
		- They can start using their emotional response as the "Antecendent" for this new behaviour of checking in
	- Separate them during the approach behaviour before the barking starts is ideal
	- Puppies are good to practice this to learn to take breaks

![This means war - How to deal with fence fighting_image_7.png](/img/user/05.%20Resources/Attachments/This%20means%20war%20-%20How%20to%20deal%20with%20fence%20fighting_image_7.png)
- Running inside is a great fall back plan
- Condition your dog to "Neighbour Dog Barking" = Check-in with you
	- You may need to be very very close with your dog and far away from the trigger
	- eventually, you can get this further from you
- Anything you can do to prevent them from joining the fence fighting is a good first step
	- Reward for any attention
- Keep the sessions extremely short (1-2 minutes)
	- If you go too long, the built up stress will make it harder and harder for the dog to disengage

![This means war - How to deal with fence fighting_image_8.png](/img/user/05.%20Resources/Attachments/This%20means%20war%20-%20How%20to%20deal%20with%20fence%20fighting_image_8.png)
- If the leash is needed to address the fence reaction. Or at least get started so you have some practice and tools to work with. But it doesn't need to be perfect
	- Credits will start to transfer
- Working in parallel an also be an option

![This means war - How to deal with fence fighting_image_9.png](/img/user/05.%20Resources/Attachments/This%20means%20war%20-%20How%20to%20deal%20with%20fence%20fighting_image_9.png)
- It depends on the dog
- You need to test it.
- On average visual barriers are helpful and worth trying first
- You can also record the sound, put up visual barrier and set the sound coming from a different place starting at a low level
- Also it is helpful because the other dog/trigger cannot see/peer in

![This means war - How to deal with fence fighting_image_10.png](/img/user/05.%20Resources/Attachments/This%20means%20war%20-%20How%20to%20deal%20with%20fence%20fighting_image_10.png)
- Distance
	- It almost always helps regardless of the situation or motivation

![This means war - How to deal with fence fighting_image_11.png](/img/user/05.%20Resources/Attachments/This%20means%20war%20-%20How%20to%20deal%20with%20fence%20fighting_image_11.png)
- This is why watching the dog is so important
- We will not always hear what they heard or see what they saw
- As soon as they "meerkat" start using treats and reinforcement
- Even if they start play acting it's fine, because they're cognitively clear enough that they are not upset adn think of it as a fun game

![This means war - How to deal with fence fighting_image_12.png](/img/user/05.%20Resources/Attachments/This%20means%20war%20-%20How%20to%20deal%20with%20fence%20fighting_image_12.png)
- In training locations, experiment with crating closer or further away to see which works better for this protocol:
	- When the other dog gets taken for a turn, the other dog left behind gets the tastiest food toy that the dog doesn't get in any other situations
- At home: 
	- The dogs are crated
	- Dog A is supposed to come out for nose work. Take Dog A out and return Dog A and Dog B stays quiet. 
	- Slowly desensitize your dog B to tolerate Dog A leaving their crate
	- Alternative: 
		- Dog A leaves crate, Dog B gets a fancy food toy
		- Continue repetitions of Dog A coming in and out of the crate while Dog B eats their toy and learns not to pay so much attention to Dog B
		- Pay attention to when the food toy runs out
- This behaviour is somewhere between frustration and habit

![This means war - How to deal with fence fighting_image_13.png](/img/user/05.%20Resources/Attachments/This%20means%20war%20-%20How%20to%20deal%20with%20fence%20fighting_image_13.png)
- With "Thank you for barking" sometimes the dog starts play acting or barking at you without even pretending that there is a trigger
- Reset - [[02. Dog Training/Training/Theory/Negative Punishment\|Negative Punishment]]
	- Walk away from the dog when they start barking at you for treats (you can even go do something else)
		- Negative Punishment = withdrawal of attention
	- After 30 seconds to a minute of silence, engage the dog with something else
		- gradually increase the wait
	- If [[Demand Barking\|Demand Barking]] is habitual
		- Standing still doesn't work well
		- Walking away works better (go do something else)

![This means war - How to deal with fence fighting_image_14.png](/img/user/05.%20Resources/Attachments/This%20means%20war%20-%20How%20to%20deal%20with%20fence%20fighting_image_14.png)
- In some situations using a second fence (~20 ft away) can help and decrease the excitement
	- Drove stakes into the ground to create a temporary fence
- Shrubs can help, but dogs are savy and will get under/between plants to get at the fence
	- It does create a sound and visual barrier

![This means war - How to deal with fence fighting_image_15.png](/img/user/05.%20Resources/Attachments/This%20means%20war%20-%20How%20to%20deal%20with%20fence%20fighting_image_15.png)
- Staying in place often builds arousal
	- Dogs moving can dismiss the situation faster than dogs standing still
- "Check It Out" is more about "Notice That"
	- Air scenting (or ground scenting) is a good time to mark for noticing a trigger
	- You can make a wider path around the trigger to avoid it or at least be far enough away that they can make good choices
- When out with your dog, pay attention to your dog in addition to the environment and use that as the point to mark and treat using the "Check it out" game above
	- Ears perking
	- Air scenting
	- Gaze snapping
	- Stiffening posture
>[!idea] Stay as cheerful as possible. Not because being cheerful will make it better but because being agitated makes it worse

![This means war - How to deal with fence fighting_image_16.png](/img/user/05.%20Resources/Attachments/This%20means%20war%20-%20How%20to%20deal%20with%20fence%20fighting_image_16.png)
- If this happens during practice you can ask your instructor to get the other dogs to stay further away
	- Before you start your run walk the perimeter of the course and play "check it out"
		- Saw a dog have a treat, saw a dog have a tug, saw a dog do an obstacle
		- Start interspersing obstacles into the check-it out treats
	- Cheerfully send the dog and send them to an obstacle
	- If the dog is choosing barking over obstacles you have a reinforcement imbalance or it has become habitual
		- Barking is stronger than the obstacles
	- See if you can practice running the obstacles without other dogs present to make them very valuable
	- Play check-it out at the start line

![This means war - How to deal with fence fighting_image_17.png](/img/user/05.%20Resources/Attachments/This%20means%20war%20-%20How%20to%20deal%20with%20fence%20fighting_image_17.png)
- In the beginning you need to let them get the full value of the reinforcer, let them run and chase until they're done
- Eventually, the birds are far enough away that they are no longer as motivating as the person with treats/toys ets
- Don't let it go for more than a minute or two
- They eventually will want to bark less because of the 
	- Matching Law applied to Premack
	- Decreasing value of the reinforcement (when an animal has ready access to a reinforcer they will eventually get temporarily tired of it)
- [[Matching Law\|Matching Law]]
	- Oversimplified In a given scenario an animal will do whatever has more reinforcement history
	- In this scenario: 
		- At the Start: Chasing Birds is very reinforcing, Eye Contact is not reinforced
		- During the Process: Chasing birds is reinforcing, Eye contact is reinforced by chasing birds
		- As it progresses: Eye contact is heavily reinforced, Chasing birds is reinforcing/enjoyable

![This means war - How to deal with fence fighting_image_18.png](/img/user/05.%20Resources/Attachments/This%20means%20war%20-%20How%20to%20deal%20with%20fence%20fighting_image_18.png)
- Play with distance. How far away do you need to be from the fence line to keep your dog focused on you
- Leash your dog to prevent accidental reinforcement
	- Be concerned about the welfare of the second dog
- Use [[02. Dog Training/Training/Theory/Shaping\|Shaping]] to increase difficulty
	- Start in the back corner of the area
	- Do I need to ask you do to stuff to keep you engaged
	- Move ~3 ft closer and ask for more work and engagement increase 
- use [[Proofing\|Proofing]] to difficult scenarios 
- Build habits of engagement

![This means war - How to deal with fence fighting_image_19.png](/img/user/05.%20Resources/Attachments/This%20means%20war%20-%20How%20to%20deal%20with%20fence%20fighting_image_19.png)
- They're a bit loose
- Simply: 
	- Dog barks, call dog, give treat, if they bark again treat again
		- They choose when the game starts
- As the dog gets more advanced call them from further away (3ft, 10, ft 20 ft)
	- Observe your dog and try to catch them when they alert ebfore the bark happens
	- Worse-case scenario you get one bark and the come to you
	- Best-case scenario you get no barks, but alert then find a person

![This means war - How to deal with fence fighting_image_20.png](/img/user/05.%20Resources/Attachments/This%20means%20war%20-%20How%20to%20deal%20with%20fence%20fighting_image_20.png)
- Get closer and interrupt on that first bark
- Hardcore: 
	- I'll only reinforce when you've barked less than 3 times (or something similar) after I've called you on the first bark
	- If you bark more than that I will go inside and I'm not paying
	- This is an example of [[02. Dog Training/Training/Theory/Differential Reinforcement of Low Rate\|Differential Reinforcement of Low Rate]]
- If three barks is too few and she's happy to fence run start with more barks and [[02. Dog Training/Training/Theory/Shaping\|Shape]] to fewer barks over time
- Data Collection: 
	- How much/how long does she bark now and use that as a baseline to [[02. Dog Training/Training/Theory/Shaping\|Shaping]]
- Once dogs realize they can get paid for barking they will become very confused if the payment stops and they will come and find you

![This means war - How to deal with fence fighting_image_21.png](/img/user/05.%20Resources/Attachments/This%20means%20war%20-%20How%20to%20deal%20with%20fence%20fighting_image_21.png)
- Sometimes (unfortunately) it is about age and you have to just wait until their brain develops when they're young as puppies and adolescents
- Licky-Mats
- Extra distance
- Dog-safe essential oil near the crate (not in the crate), e.g. lavendar on a towel near the crate
	- Essential oils can be toxic to cats
- Dog Appeasement Pheromone
	- The diffusers can be used in an indoor space
	- Use the spray (not on the dog, ever)
	- Spray it on a towel, let the alcohol evaporate and place towel in a crate
	- How effective it is varies by dog
- A fan to blow odors away from the crate (firing across the entrance of the crate aimed low)

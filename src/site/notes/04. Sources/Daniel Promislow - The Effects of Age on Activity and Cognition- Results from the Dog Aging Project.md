# Biology of Aging
- Major causes of disease have a number of risk factors (heart disease, cancer, alzheimers) But aging as a risk factor dwarfs all other factors
- ![[Daniel Promislow - The Effects of Age on Activity and Cognition- Results from the Dog Aging Project_image_1.png\|Daniel Promislow - The Effects of Age on Activity and Cognition- Results from the Dog Aging Project_image_1.png]]
	- Understanding the way that aging works can help us address the causes of mortality dependently and independently of aging
- Hallmarks of aging (Lopez-Otin, et al. Cell 2013)
	- Telomere shortening
	- Genomic instability
	- epigenetic changes
	- loss of proteostasis
	- deregulatenutrient signaling
	- mitochondrial dysfuction
	- cellular sensscence
	- Stem cell exhaustion
	- Altered cell-cell communication
- We can slow the effect of ages via DNA or lifestyle/pharmaceuticals in lab settings but the real world is more complex because of genetic variability inherent to natural selection
# Why study aging in dogs
- The project was inspired by a 2007 by Ostrander et al. (in Science) called [A Single 1GF1 Allele is a major determinant of small size in dogs](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17412960/)(Sutter et al. 2007)
	- Small breed dogs have a unique IGF1 allele that is different to the wolf variation (wild type) that is wide spread across other dog breeds
![[Daniel Promislow - The Effects of Age on Activity and Cognition- Results from the Dog Aging Project_image_2.png\|Daniel Promislow - The Effects of Age on Activity and Cognition- Results from the Dog Aging Project_image_2.png]]
- In Humans [[IGF1\|IGF1]] is associated with aging and lifespan
![[Daniel Promislow - The Effects of Age on Activity and Cognition- Results from the Dog Aging Project_image_3.png\|Daniel Promislow - The Effects of Age on Activity and Cognition- Results from the Dog Aging Project_image_3.png]]
![[Daniel Promislow - The Effects of Age on Activity and Cognition- Results from the Dog Aging Project_image_4.png\|Daniel Promislow - The Effects of Age on Activity and Cognition- Results from the Dog Aging Project_image_4.png]]

- Dogs have an amazing variation compared to wolves which provides a lot of genetic variation that is excellent for getting real world data on aging
- Environmental factors are wildly variable based on location, family and demographics
- Dogs have a healthcare system and relationship with people and so there is detailed information from birth to death about health, lifecourse and experiences
- Dogs are well-loved by their families

## What we currently know about dog aging
- There is a diversity of most common age-related diseased across breeds
	- Bulldogs respiratory
	- Chihua - heart disease
- Humans and dogs have similar mortality curved by cause over their life span
	- Cancer:
		- Humans: peaks at middle age and declines
		- Dogs: peaks at middle age and declines
	- Toxic death
- BUt there are differences
	- Heart Disease
		- Humans: starts rising in 20s and continues with age
		- Dog: get a little bit of heart disease but it stays the same (and generally low) over their life spans
- Dogs experience multiple mobilidities
	- which is true for humans
- Dogs experience frailty
	- the vet world does not have good definitions (declining energy, mobility and cognition)
	- Important for quality of life and research
	- But there is a questions of whether it's a cause of aging or consequence of agng
- Sterilized dogs live longer
	- Sterilized dogs live longer than those intact. They are not prospective studies only retrospective data
	- ![[Daniel Promislow - The Effects of Age on Activity and Cognition- Results from the Dog Aging Project_image_5.png\|Daniel Promislow - The Effects of Age on Activity and Cognition- Results from the Dog Aging Project_image_5.png]]
	- Sterilized dogs are more likely to die of auto-immune diseases and cancer. 
	- Intact dogs are more likely to die or Trauma and Infection
	- [[Effect of Sterilization on dog lifespan - biological or environmental\|Effect of Sterilization on dog lifespan - biological or environmental]]
# The Dog Aging Project - Overview
The [[02. Notes/Notes/Dog Aging Project\|Dog Aging Project]] (DAP) launched on November 14th 2019

## Objective of the Dog Aging Project 
1. Identify genetic and environmental determinants of healthy aging in companion dogs
2. Determine how to maximize healthy aging in dogs

## Experimental Design
- Different dog groups studied at varying levels: 
	- **DAP Pack = 32,000+ dog**
		- Health and Life Experience Survey
		- 50% uploaded electronic medical records
			- **Foundation 8500 dogs**
				- DNA samples (cheek swab) for genes associated with traits
			- **Precision 1000 dogs**
				- Vet collected sample collection (molecular and clinical data)
			- **Intervention 350**
				- Testing rapamycin (found to extend lives in lab mice)
	- **Centanarian Cohort** 300 dogs
		- Extremely old dogs who for their size are outliers on longevity
![[Daniel Promislow - The Effects of Age on Activity and Cognition- Results from the Dog Aging Project_image_6.png\|700]]
See general process above and samples collected below
![[Daniel Promislow - The Effects of Age on Activity and Cognition- Results from the Dog Aging Project_image_7.png\|700]]

Data Collected (genetic and environment) compared to phenotype and aging symptoms and the Mechanisms hypothesized to related to phenotype expression. (see below)
![[Daniel Promislow - The Effects of Age on Activity and Cognition- Results from the Dog Aging Project_image_8.png\|Daniel Promislow - The Effects of Age on Activity and Cognition- Results from the Dog Aging Project_image_8.png]]

- On December 31st of each year, the [[02. Notes/Notes/Dog Aging Project\|Dog Aging Project]] released their cleaned data on https://data.dogagingproject.org

# The DAP - 2021 Results
As of 2021, the data is [[cross sectional data\|cross sectional data]] but the intent is to expand into [[longitudinal data\|longitudinal data]] when people return to the site and complete the survey every year. 

- Diseases associated with aging become more common as dogs age, such as cancer
- When broken down by size, large-breed dogs are more likely to develop cancer at any age than small breed dogs

## Aging and Activity
- Aging affects walking speed (if this has not been reported then there might have been problems with the data)
	- Activity decreases as they get older across activity, intensity and duration
	- Rural dogs are more active than urban and suburban dogs
- Size
	- Large breed dogs are more active and age faster in terns of activity
- Human Age
	- Dogs of older owners are reported as more active. 
	- The older the owners the more their dogs spend more time outside
## Aging and Cognition
- Watowich et al. 2020 (Animal Congition) used other data to study cognition and asked the questions of whether the pattern of cognitive decline was the same across ages or if older dogs have a more repid decline
	- She found that older dogs do not experience as much cognitive decline (image to the left) because they do not live as long to have cognitive decline
	- ![[Daniel Promislow - The Effects of Age on Activity and Cognition- Results from the Dog Aging Project_image_9.png\|700]]
- DAP data of the Canine Social and Learned Behaviour Score
	- Canine Cognitive Dysfunction is 50
	- ![[Daniel Promislow - The Effects of Age on Activity and Cognition- Results from the Dog Aging Project_image_10.png\|Daniel Promislow - The Effects of Age on Activity and Cognition- Results from the Dog Aging Project_image_10.png]]
- Aging and Health
	- General Health
		- Dogs with the worst tend to be the oldest (score of 6)
	- Disease Counts
		- Older dogs tend to have more disease counts than younger dogs
 ![[Daniel Promislow - The Effects of Age on Activity and Cognition- Results from the Dog Aging Project_image_11.png\|700]]
- McCoy et al. Unpublished
	- Several environmental factors influence dog health
	- Older owners report having healthier dogs than younger owners
 ![[Daniel Promislow - The Effects of Age on Activity and Cognition- Results from the Dog Aging Project_image_12.png\|Daniel Promislow - The Effects of Age on Activity and Cognition- Results from the Dog Aging Project_image_12.png]]
- DAP is an open data project for anyone who wants to study the data
- They are working to create collaborations across the scientific community, human longitudinal studies, education and interdisciplinary collaborations

# Q&A
![[Daniel Promislow - The Effects of Age on Activity and Cognition- Results from the Dog Aging Project_image_13.png\|Daniel Promislow - The Effects of Age on Activity and Cognition- Results from the Dog Aging Project_image_13.png]]
- Intact dogs are more likely to roam and engage in sexual activity and conflict (equal trauma and infection)
- Cancer details: 
	- Prostate cancer is independent of sterilization
	- Intact females are at higher risk of mammary cancers
![[Daniel Promislow - The Effects of Age on Activity and Cognition- Results from the Dog Aging Project_image_14.png\|Daniel Promislow - The Effects of Age on Activity and Cognition- Results from the Dog Aging Project_image_14.png]]
- there are far more microbes in and on the human body than actual cells
	- The skin and gut microbiomes are different and skin microbiomes differ across regions

![[Daniel Promislow - The Effects of Age on Activity and Cognition- Results from the Dog Aging Project_image_15.png\|Daniel Promislow - The Effects of Age on Activity and Cognition- Results from the Dog Aging Project_image_15.png]]
- Yes
- The raw data may not be meaningful (base codes) but processed data is relevant: 
	- Breed
	- Coat colour and type
	- Genome markers for disease risk (once they get more data over the years)
		- Tricky with vet practice across state lines so the process will be a work in progress

![[Daniel Promislow - The Effects of Age on Activity and Cognition- Results from the Dog Aging Project_image_16.png\|500]]![[Daniel Promislow - The Effects of Age on Activity and Cognition- Results from the Dog Aging Project_image_17.png\|500]]
- There are not many 17-19 year old dogs so a small number can impact the data a lot
	- People who have 15+ year old dogs sign up because their dogs are still in good condition and may live a few more years. People who's old dogs are experiencing a terminal condition won't bother to sign up
- This is a cross sectional study. The real power will come when multiple time points are collected and it becomes longitudina
	- Likely there will be a linear trend once the current 7 year old dogs start to age

![[Daniel Promislow - The Effects of Age on Activity and Cognition- Results from the Dog Aging Project_image_18.png\|Daniel Promislow - The Effects of Age on Activity and Cognition- Results from the Dog Aging Project_image_18.png]]
- New data post presentation recording: Looked at owner age on cognitive scores
	- Even for younger dogs older owners report their dogs as having higher cognition than expected
- Precision and TRIAD cohorts will receive activity monitors to see if there is a difference between owner-reported activity versus measured activity

![[Daniel Promislow - The Effects of Age on Activity and Cognition- Results from the Dog Aging Project_image_19.png\|500]] ![[Daniel Promislow - The Effects of Age on Activity and Cognition- Results from the Dog Aging Project_image_20.png\|500]]
- Not something thought about until the question was asked
- Other than parasitic disease (which is for very young dogs) problems start showing up around year 2-3 but it would be something they need to look at more carefully.

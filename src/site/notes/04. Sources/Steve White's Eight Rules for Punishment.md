1. The punishment must be something the animal dislikes AND something the animal does not expect
2. The punishment must suppress behaviour (this is, in fact, the very definition of something that is a punisher). If something is being used for punishment, but it does not suppress behaviour, it’s ineffective and often just plain abuse
3. The punishment must be of the perfect intensity. Too much and there will be negative fallout. You’ll end up hurting your relationship with the animal and losing more than just that behaviour. Too little and the punishment will only serve to desensitize the animal and build resistance
4. The punishment must happen immediately after the behaviour it is to be associated with. Otherwise, a clear enough association between the wrong behaviour and the punishment will not be made
5. The punishment must be associated with the behaviour, not with the trainer. Otherwise, the trainer becomes part of the punishment and the animal starts fearing and disliking the trainer
6. The punishment must happen every time the behaviour occurs. If punishment does not happen every time the behaviour occurs, the behaviour gets put on a variable schedule of reinforcement. Depending on the behaviour and how often the punishment actually occurs, the animal could decide that performing the behaviour was worth the risk of getting punished
7. There must be an alternative for the animal
8. Punishment must never be used to the extent that punishment outweighs positive reinforcement (from the animal’s perspective, not yours!)

1. Punishment has to be effective
2. Punishment has to be immediate
3. Punishment has to be instructive
4. Punishment must be appropriate 
5. Punishment should only be delivered when appropriate behaviour is known
6. Punishment should only follow a warning. Dogs should be given the opportunity to avoid the punishment 
7. Rewards are always preferred. It is much easier to reward the one ‘right’ behaviour, than punish a bunch of less desirable behaviours
8. Punishments must be consistent. A punishment must occur each and every time the dog misbehaves, as inconsistent punishments act as random negative reinforcers (a strong form of reinforcement)

### Further reflection from Dunbar
Consider the following regarding positive punishment:
- Does it reduce the behaviour’s frequency?
- Is it painful or scary?

From here, four possible scenarios:
- Punishment that is painful or scary, and changes behaviour, is effective but undesirable
- Punishment that is painful or scary but doesn’t change behaviour is abusive
- Punishment that is not painful or scary and doesn’t change behaviour is nagging. It’s annoying, a nuisance
- Punishment that is not painful and not scary, but is effective, is desirable. (This is where Ian Dunbar chooses to work.)
